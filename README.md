# LaTeX-in-Sublime-Text-3
A visual guide for setting up a lightweight LaTeX editor in Sublime.

# Background
LaTeX is a beautiful tool for academic writing and there are many editing environments built on the Tex platform that are freely available. My favorite editor is Overleaf but there are features that the platform offers that are blocked by a pay-wall. This is a visual guide for setting up a similar LaTeX editing environment in Sublime Text 3 (ST3) using open-source packages for Windows 10. However, build instructions for Mac OS and Linux devices are provided in the official documentation for LaTeXTools.

A full list of features offered by LaTeXTools can be found here. More capabilities can be added as desired by installing additional packages created by the community. Examples are provided in the 'Additional Resources' section along with descriptions of my own perosnal favorites.

## Minimum Requirements
- Windows 10 (x64)
- Sublime Text 3
- A Tex distribution (i.e. MiKTeX or TexLive)
- Sumatra PDF

# Installation

## 1. Install the Required Software
### Sublime Text 3 (x64)
### MikTeX or TexLive
Either will work on Windows. TexLive will take longer to initially install but has all the required packages. MiKTeX is a shorter initial installation but will require further packages to be downloaded on the first build. Pick one and follow the relevant documentation.
### Sumatra PDF
The Sumatra PDF Viewer is recommended by the developers of LaTeXTools. Its very light-weight and supports both forward and inverse search. It is also the only viewer supported on Windows that is compatible with LaTeXTools.


## 2. Install Optional Software

## 4. Install LaTexTools Package
## 5. Configure LaTeXTools Settings
