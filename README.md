# LaTeX-in-Sublime-Text-3
A visual guide to setting up LaTeX in Sublime.

# Background
LaTeX is a beautiful tool for academic writing and there are many editing environments built on the Tex platform that are freely available. My favorite editor is Overleaf but there are features that the platform offers that are blocked by a pay-wall. This is a visual guide for setting up a similar LaTeX editing environment in Sublime Text 3 (ST3) using open-source packages for Windows 10.

# Minimum Software Requirements
- Windows 10 (x64)
- Sublime Text 3
- A Tex Distribution (i.e. MiKTeX or TexLive)
- Sumatra PDF

# Installation

## Install the Required Software
1. Sublime Text 3 (x64)
2. MikTeX or TexLive
	Either will work on Windows. TexLive will take longer to initially install but has all the required packages. MiKTeX is a shorter initial installation but will require further packages to be downloaded on the first build. Pick one and follow the relevant documentation.
3. Sumatra PDF
	The Sumatra PDF Viewer is recommended by the developers of LaTeXTools. Its very light-weight and supports both forward and inverse search. It is also the only viewer supported on Windows that is compatible with LaTeXTools.


## Install Optional Software
## Update system PATH Variable
## Install LaTexTools Package
## Configure LaTeXTools Settings
## Setup Sumatra
## Test Build
## Install Additional Sublime Packages
